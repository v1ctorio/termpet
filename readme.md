# TermPet

A terminal pet that can be used to keep you company while you work in the terminal.







# Installation
## Termpet
You can install termpet downloading its release binaries from [the releases](https://github.com/v1ctorio/termpet/releases/latest), install it with the nix flake (`nix profile install github:v1ctorio/termpet`) or using go `go instal github.com/v1ctorio/termpet`
#### Cowsay
To use TermPet with it's default configuration, you need to have `cowsay` installed on your system. I recommend using [Neo-cowsay](https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay).

You can easily install it for windows using winget (`winget install neo-cowsay`) or using go `go install github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/cmd/v2/cowsay@latest`

For Linux you also can install it using go or using nix (`nix profile install nixpkgs#neo-cowsay`). Also, the package `cowsay` is most likely in your distro repositories.
